Photograma is a mobile application created for my CS bachelor-thesis. The main idea is to create an application for photographers to share their passion and interest for photography and art with people who are willing to have an enjoyable photo shoot.

  - Create an account
  - Login to that account
  - Share your photos or search for a photographer that matches your preferences
  - Create an appointment
  - Enjoy your time and your photos
